    Reasons why Ann Stewart should be my girlfriend:
  </h2>
  <h2>
    If she was my girl friend:
    I would always answer her texts fast so that she knows how important she is to me.
    I would not cheat on her becuase I care deelply about how she feels and could never be happy with another girl.
    I would make her feel very special with gifts.
    I would always make her laugh.
    We have good chemistry and our relationship would be perfect.
    She has a boyfriend but I will not give up.
